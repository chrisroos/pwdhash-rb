A ruby port of the password hashing functionality found on [pwdhash.com](https://www.pwdhash.com/).

There's also a version named [pwdhash.rb](https://github.com/kizzx2/pwdhash.rb) that contains enhancements to this code.  You'll probably want that version rather than this.

I've added the code here as I'm in the process of migrating projects from googlecode to github and I wanted the commit history.
